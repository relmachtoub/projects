Project description:

Create computer vision model that can recognize underage customers based off their photo.

The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.

The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age based off a photo.

Summary of steps taken:

1. Uploaded data using image data generator.
2. Split data into training and test sets.
3. Ran EDA to check for target imbalance.
4. Created nueral network using TensorFlow & ResNet50 Architecture.
5. Optomized hyperparameters.
6. Tested model on cloud based GPU.
