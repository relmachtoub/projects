Project description:

The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws
by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:

The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol.

Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.

The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age based off a photo.

Summary of steps taken:

1. Uploaded data using image data generator.
2. Ran EDA to check for target imbalance.
3. Created nueral network using TensorFlow & ResNet50 Architecture.
4. Optomized hyperparameters.
5. Tested model on cloud based GPU.
