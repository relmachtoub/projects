Project:

Import files from Zuber ride sharing company & study data,
make sure the data types are correct, identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs.

Summary of steps taken:
1. Preprocess data and run exploratory data analysis.
2. Find Top 10 Neighborhoods for Drop Off's in Chicago.
3. Plot Taxi Companies vs Number of Rides.
4. Test the hypothesis:
- "The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."
- Null Hypothesis: The average duration of rides on Saturdays is the same for good and bad weather conditions.
- Alt Hypothesis: The average duration of rides on Saturdays is different for good and bad weather conditions.

Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. The p-value of the test is less than an alpha value of 0.05, 
hence there is evidence that the average duration of rides on Saturdays is significantly different for good and bad weather conditions.
