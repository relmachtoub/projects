The objective of this project was to import the files,
study the data they contain, make sure the data types are correct,
identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs.

The following graphs we're made: taxi companies and number of rides, 
top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs. 
We drew conclusions based on each graph and explain the results.

Test the hypothesis: "The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."

Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. The p-value of the test is less than an alpha value of 0.05, 
hence there is evidence that the average duration of rides on Saturdays is significantly different for good and bad weather conditions.
